374,86,Timo Schick,"[' We have devised a novel approach for the challenging task of AMR-to-text generation. Our core idea was to turn input AMR graphs into ordered trees from which sentences\ncan easily be inferred through application of the yield function. We chose the principle\ncomponent of our approach to be the transition system SAMR, whose set of transitions\nTAMR defines how the transformation from AMR graphs to suitable trees can be per-\nformed. Some transitions contained within this set, such as Merge, Swap and Delete,\nhave an equivalent in the likewise transition-based text-to-AMR parser by Wang et al. (2015), which served as a model for our approach. In order to turn SAMR into a generator, we assigned probabilities to transitions and\ndefined the score of a transition sequence to be a linear combination of the probabilities\nof all its transitions and the probability assigned to the resulting sentence by a language\nmodel. We approximated these probabilities using maximum entropy models that were\ntrained with a set of gold transitions extracted from a large corpus of AMR graphs and\ncorresponding realizations.', 'As an exhaustive search for the highest-scoring transition\nsequence given some input would be far too time-consuming, we developed an algorithm\nthat approximates this sequence in two phases: In a first phase, only transitions from\na subset Trestr of TAMR are greedily applied without taking the language model into\nconsideration; in a second phase, the output of this first phase is processed bottom-\nup, considering multiple partial transition sequences at each step and factoring in the\nlanguage model.

378,90,Timo Schick,"[' We have devised a novel approach for the challenging task of AMR-to-text generation. Our core idea was to turn input AMR graphs into ordered trees from which sentences\ncan easily be inferred through application of the yield function. We chose the principle\ncomponent of our approach to be the transition system SAMR, whose set of transitions\nTAMR defines how the transformation from AMR graphs to suitable trees can be per-\nformed. Some transitions contained within this set, such as Merge, Swap and Delete,\nhave an equivalent in the likewise transition-based text-to-AMR parser by Wang et al. (2015), which served as a model for our approach. In order to turn SAMR into a generator, we assigned probabilities to transitions and\ndefined the score of a transition sequence to be a linear combination of the probabilities\nof all its transitions and the probability assigned to the resulting sentence by a language\nmodel. We approximated these probabilities using maximum entropy models that were\ntrained with a set of gold transitions extracted from a large corpus of AMR graphs and\ncorresponding realizations.', 'As an exhaustive search for the highest-scoring transition\nsequence given some input would be far too time-consuming, we developed an algorithm\nthat approximates this sequence in two phases: In a first phase, only transitions from\na subset Trestr of TAMR are greedily applied without taking the language model into\nconsideration; in a second phase, the output of this first phase is processed bottom-\nup, considering multiple partial transition sequences at each step and factoring in the\nlanguage model. Through parametrized pruning, we restricted the number of sequences\nto be considered, allowing us to find a good balance between required time and quality\nof the generated sentences. We introduced the concepts of syntactic annotations and\ndefault realizations to help our system decide which transition to apply next. To further\nimprove our results, we defined some postprocessing steps – such as the insertion of\npunctuation marks – to revise the tree structure obtained from our transition system. In experiments carried out using a Java-based implementation of our generator, we\nobtained a lower-cased 1 . . . 4-gram Bleu score of 27.4 on the LDC2014T12 test set,\nthe second best result reported so far and the best without using parsed sentences\nfrom an external source such as Gigaword (LDC2011T07) as additional training data.', 'This result strongly suggests that our transition-based transformation of AMR graphs\ninto ordered tree structures is indeed quite a promising approach for the AMR-to-text\ngeneration task. Throughout this work, we have highlighted a number of ways in which the results\nobtained by our system may further be improved upon. As outlined in Section 6, one\npromising way that could easily be implemented, but would require access to Gigaword,\nwould be to replace the used 3-gram language model with some higher-order model. One could also follow the idea of Konstas et al. (2017) and annotate Gigaword sentences\nwith AMR graphs using a parser to augment the number of available training data; as\npointed out in Section 6, it is reasonable to assume that implementing this idea would\nhave a major impact on the quality of our generator. Another possible modification shown to be promising in Section 6 is the redefinition of\nMerge transitions to allow for a merging of neighboring vertices. It is also conceivable to modify this transition in a way that allows for vertex groups of arbitrary size to be\nmerged. In this context, one may also investigate whether the generator could further\nbe tweaked by revising other classes of transitions.', 'Of course, such a revision does not\nhave to be limited to the formal definitions of the transitions themselves, but may also\nbe extended to the extraction of gold transitions from a training corpus as done by the\noracle algorithm introduced in Section 4.3.3.
